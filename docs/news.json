Two weeks ago, a maintenance crew arrived unannounced to erect an enormous gantry on the terrace in order to access windows  below that need repairs. We were told the work would take a few days, but they\u2019re nowhere near finished. Since the crews require access to our apartment to reach the terrace, they come and go at all hours, sometimes arriving before we are out of bed, and traipse through all day. While they work, we have no privacy unless we lower all the blinds and sit in the dark. The workers do not consistently wear masks, and balked at my questions about their vaccination status. Can we set any limits?",

Acmella oleracea, also known as buzz buttons or electric daisies, are known for their potent tingling effect. I\u2019m not sure I like it. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s even the point.

The empty grid is a bit disconcerting to me \u2014 the alternating bands of gray and white have an optical-illusion effect and the lack of breaks between any of the words is intimidating. It\u2019s hard to adjust to words running in four directions \u2014 across from right to left and up, as well as across from left to right and down. But as long as I get lucky with the across entries, or the beginnings of the bands, I find this variety grid more pleasant than frustrating.",

In a matter of weeks, Mr. Musk, the richest person in the world, took his bid from something that investors shrugged off to a serious proposal. The turning point came when he filed documents showing he had the financing to back up his offer. Now, it could be the largest deal to take a company private in at least 20 years, according to data from Dealogic. Still, much remains uncertain as to how the mercurial billionaire will carry out his vision for a platform with less moderation. ",

But here, the royal beauty feigns sleep. Five minutes into this slender yet vigorous blood-spattered fable, two enemy guards enter to drag our heroine to the chapel \u2014 and she brutally kills them. Clearly, the classic genre that galvanizes Kiet and the screenwriters Ben Lustig and Jake Thornton doesn\u2019t hark back to ye olde European fairy tales but rather to the feminist revenge thrillers of the 1970s: works of exploitation and wuxia cinema where warrior women stuck it to the man. With knives.",

Some viognier and gew\u00fcrztraminer are also blended in. The unusual result is pale and refreshing, with hints of citrus zest and a whisper of nutty toastiness.

He went often to Yemen, escaped the raging civil war and founded a company, Port of Mokha, to sell coffee. Last week, while tasting several coffees from Yemen Mr. Alkhanshali said he also wanted to create a nonprofit organization to help coffee farmers, 75 percent of whom are women; the result is the Mokha Institute. This year for the first time, it will run the National Yemen Coffee Auction open to roasters worldwide. The institute has selected 28 coffees, out of an original collection of 161, for the online auction; registration is open until Aug. 15 and the auction will be held Aug. 31. He said that roasters from 20 countries are expected to participate. Much of Yemen\u2019s coffee, all arabica, is grown on steep terraced land in the mountainous western part of the country and is sun-dried, not washed. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much water,\u201d he said.",

It deploys flat and journalistic language to describe the violence of colonialism in America. The poem is written primarily in declaratives: The speaker lists medical facts in the first section and cites incorrect facts in the second. The ending simply states that the speaker lacks \u201cShawnee words\u201d to describe their nation and culture, and that the only language that\u2019s available is the colonial lingo of surveying and measuring. In this way, the diction of the poem mirrors the precise (but historically incorrect) and cold grammar of cartography. Selected by Victoria Chang",

        "lead_paragraph": "Though not a duet, Elton John\u2019s latest project is a harmony of sorts. An avid collector of black-and-white photography, the singer has handpicked 50 Peter Hujar prints for an exhibition at San Francisco\u2019s Fraenkel Gallery. Opening next week, \u201cPeter Hujar curated by Elton John\u201d showcases the photographer\u2019s breadth of subjects, which range from seascapes to beefcake to pets. \u201cI\u2019d long wanted to invite a formidable guest curator to dig into Hujar\u2019s work,\u201d says Jeffrey Fraenkel, who\u2019s represented the artist\u2019s estate since the early 2000s. \u201cI came up with about a half dozen names, mostly writers and visual artists, but the idea of Elton seemed unbeatable.\u201d Besides the fact that John has acquired 15 works by Hujar since 2011, the union made emotional sense to Fraenkel. \u201cHujar\u2019s work focused on the [queer] cultural scene, male erotica and other issues that overlap with Elton\u2019s interests,\u201d says Fraenkel. Hujar is perhaps best known for his images of members of the cultural vanguard of 1970s and \u201980s New York \u2014 among them Fran Lebowitz, Susan Sontag and David Wojnarowicz, who was Hujar\u2019s partner. John made a point of choosing some of the photographer\u2019s less-seen portraits, including those variously depicting a young Stevie Wonder, a middle-aged Peggy Lee and the Warhol acolyte Jackie Curtis in her open casket. \u201cThe show doesn\u2019t shy away from the tough pictures about illness or death, which are main components of Hujar\u2019s work,\u201d says Fraenkel. Hujar himself died of complications from AIDS in 1987. Fittingly, all proceeds from the show\u2019s first two sales will go to the Elton John AIDS Foundation. On view from Sept. 8 through Oct. 22, fraenkelgallery.com.",

We recently asked the co-op board to allow us to transfer the property to an irrevocable trust, so that when we die he will still have a place to live. The board denied our request. Now we are in a quandary. Our son cannot inherit property directly or he will no longer be able to receive the government benefits that support him. How do we manage this situation?",

        "lead_paragraph": "The new British government\u2019s announcement last week that it planned to make drastic tax cuts sent markets tumbling, the pound sinking and the Bank of England scrambling to restore some calm. The panic stemmed from fear that the tax and spending measures proposed by Britain\u2019s recently appointed prime minister, Liz Truss, would add to soaring inflation in the country, running up against the central bank\u2019s efforts to rein it in. Ms. Truss\u2019s government argues that cutting taxes will stimulate investments and that the benefits will buoy the rest of the economy \u2014 but investors do not appear convinced. Their unease rippled throughout Europe and to the United States, where benchmark indexes slid. The pound hit its lowest recorded point, creeping near parity with the dollar. On Wednesday, the Bank of England stepped in, saying it will undertake large-scale purchases of British government bonds in the coming weeks to \u201crestore orderly market conditions.\u201d Its forceful intervention pushed the pound back up slightly and helped markets regain some of their losses.",

In England, where he\u2019d spent most of his life, he had shown very little interest in cooking. In Greece, where he was born and where he returned to live much later, he was now fanatical about it. Research began. Tavernas were scouted and recipes recorded. One summer when I visited him, we went together to a restaurant on the island of Paros. There he had discovered fava, a pea or bean pur\u00e9e, yellow and buttery, that he thought was the best he\u2019d ever had. He felt it deserving of a page in his book. I watched him photograph the dish from above, his shirt damp with midafternoon sweat, the cotton pulled tight against his belly, the fava set against a plain white tablecloth.",

Her father abandoned the family when she was a toddler. Her mother, an artist, remarried a mechanic, and the couple worked as migratory fruit pickers, drifting west until they eventually settled near Portland, Ore. As a teenager, too broke to buy drugs, Dunn later joked, she would sometimes try to catch bugs in order to get high. Dunn\u2019s mother beat her; once, she threw a screwdriver that punctured Dunn\u2019s calf, leaving a lifelong scar. When Dunn was 17, she left home for good. After a brief stint in jail for attempting to pass a bad check, she enrolled in Reed College. She fell in love, dropped out of Reed and traveled around the world before returning to Portland to raise her son, Eli. She cobbled together jobs, wrapping candy on assembly lines and posing nude for life-drawing classes. She also waited tables and bartended at dive bars where she dodged biker-gang fights. A patron once tried to slit her throat.",

The path is called, rather unassumingly, Bridge Approach, and a five-minute walk leads to Primrose Hill. I happened to live in these parts for three years, and I crossed the overpass twice a day most days. Just to the south is the Pembroke Castle pub, where Liam Gallagher of Oasis was once arrested, in 1998. Another neighborhood tippler, Kingsley Amis, favored the Queen\u2019s at the corner of St. George\u2019s Terrace, according to his biographer Zachary Leader, who printed his monthly tab. From my balcony I could see the phone box where Sylvia Plath would desperately call Ted Hughes at his lover\u2019s flat in her last days. It is a quiet neighborhood, but one dense with intrigue and peopled by famous, messy and tortured artistic personages.",

        "lead_paragraph": "\u201cSvonni v. the Swedish Tax Agency\u201d is a five-minute Op-Doc film that touches on themes of tradition, respect, bureaucracy and discrimination. It profiles Ida-Maria Svonni, a Sami woman fighting for her right to claim a tax deduction for the purchase of a dog. Why doesn\u2019t the Swedish Tax Agency understand that her dog, Rikke, is an essential tool for reindeer herding and not simply a pet? To answer this question, the humorous short film reveals a larger cultural clash and the struggle to practice Sami culture in today\u2019s Sweden.",

It appears that fraught legal battles lie ahead, and it\u2019s unclear whether Musk\u2019s aim is to win or simply punish.",

There\u2019s still a wall of family photos \u2014 the Livanos family is from the village of Molyvos on the island of Lesbos \u2014 and another of painted plates from the island of Rhodes. The restaurant will continue to offer home-style fare, like stuffed peppers and meatballs along with a fairly typical Greek lineup, but what will not be available for the reopening are the grilled fish and lamb specialties. Gas has yet to be connected. \u201cWe are able to provide about 75 percent of our menu as it is,\u201d Mr. Livanos said. Added to the menu and not derailed by the lack of fuel is a new section of raw, chilled and marinated dishes like Ionian hamachi crudo with anise carrot pur\u00e9e, ouzo-cured salmon, marinated sardines en croute and smoked Ioanian eel with a ouzo-blood orange glaze.

So I\u2019ve finally aborted my attempts to read \u201cUlysses\u201d (I bought a crib for it and found I preferred the crib to the book), and abandoned half a dozen self-published books by friends hoping for an endorsement (sigh!) and one or two books I\u2019d started but somehow run out of steam on. My husband accuses me of slavishly buying any book that is well reviewed and any book anyone at all recommends. So now we are down to half a dozen. I liked \u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing,\u201d by Delia Owens \u2014 a charming story of a wild girl child growing up alone in the U.S. Southern marshes. Then there\u2019s \u201cThe Inevitable,\u201d a really beautifully written book about a difficult subject: assisted dying. I campaign for the right to get help to die if you are terminally ill and living a horrible life. \u201cThe Inevitable,\u201d by the journalist Katie Engelhart, follows the experience of dying people in jurisdictions where assisted dying is legal. It\u2019s a complex and fascinating subject and Engelhart writes with intelligence and compassion.",

Drawing on dozens of interviews, he presented evidence suggesting that the Israeli Army had killed scores of Palestinians after capturing the village. In this version of history, Israel wasn\u2019t fighting a war; it was committing a massacre.",
